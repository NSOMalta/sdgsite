The National Statistics Office (NSO) has launched a new website featuring Malta’s data related to the 
indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs and their targets form 
a global framework established by the United Nations to enhance economic growth, social inclusion, and 
environmental protection by 2030, monitored through 234 unique indicators. This new website provides 
a platform for users to access data and information that highlight Malta’s progress towards achieving the 
SDGs and their respective targets. 

In 2021, the Cabinet established a National Expert Group on Sustainable Development Indicators and 
appointed the NSO to chair the Expert Group and its related taskforces. The primary mandate of the 
Expert Group was to evaluate the data sets used for the SDG indicators, identify data gaps, and manage 
the data and information flows from national authorities to international organisations responsible for 
monitoring the SDGs. Following this intensive exercise, the NSO embarked on a project to consolidate all 
quality-checked and SDG-relevant data onto a single platform. This platform allows users to easily access 
Malta-related data for each respective SDG. The website, which will be continuously updated, can be 
accessed directly from sdgindicators.nso.gov.mt or from the website of the NSO.
